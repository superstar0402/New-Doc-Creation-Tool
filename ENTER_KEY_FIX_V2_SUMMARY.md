# Enter Key Fix V2 Summary

## Problem Description
When pressing the Enter key in the rich text editor, the cursor was jumping to the beginning of the sentence instead of staying on the new line, which is not the expected Microsoft Word-like behavior. This issue was occurring even after previous fixes were reverted.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by several factors:

1. **Aggressive Re-rendering**: The `useEffect` that handles content updates was re-rendering the editor content even during active editing, which interfered with cursor positioning.

2. **Poor Cursor Position Management**: The Enter key handling wasn't properly managing cursor position after inserting line breaks.

3. **Unnecessary onChange Calls**: The `handleContentChange` function was calling `onChange` even when content hadn't changed, causing unnecessary re-renders.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Enter Key Handling
```typescript
// Handle Enter key for normal text (non-list)
const selection = window.getSelection();
if (selection && selection.rangeCount > 0) {
  const range = selection.getRangeAt(0);
  
  // Insert a line break at the current position
  const br = document.createElement('br');
  range.deleteContents();
  range.insertNode(br);
  
  // Create a new text node after the line break for the cursor
  const textNode = document.createTextNode('');
  br.parentNode?.insertBefore(textNode, br.nextSibling);
  
  // Position cursor at the beginning of the new text node
  range.setStart(textNode, 0);
  range.collapse(true);
  selection.removeAllRanges();
  selection.addRange(range);
}
```

### 2. Reduced Re-rendering Interference
```typescript
// Don't re-render if the editor is focused and the content is similar
// This prevents interference with active editing
if (isFocused && editorRef.current.innerText === value) {
  return;
}

// Restore caret position after DOM update, but only if not actively editing
if (typeof caretPosition === 'number' && !isFocused) {
  restoreCaretPosition(editorRef.current, caretPosition);
}
```

### 3. Optimized Content Change Handling
```typescript
// Only call onChange if the content has actually changed
// This prevents unnecessary re-renders that could interfere with cursor position
if (content !== value) {
  onChange(content, formattedContent);
}
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **`handleKeyDown` function**: Improved Enter key handling to properly insert line breaks and position cursor correctly using DOM manipulation.

2. **`useEffect` for content initialization**: Added checks to prevent re-rendering during active editing and only restore cursor position when not focused.

3. **`handleContentChange` function**: Added content comparison to prevent unnecessary onChange calls that could trigger re-renders.

4. **Cursor positioning**: Implemented proper cursor positioning after line break insertion using DOM manipulation instead of relying on browser defaults.

5. **Preserved existing functionality**: All existing text formatting functions (bold, italic, underline) remain fully functional.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Correct Behavior:**
- Enter key creates a new line
- Cursor moves to the beginning of the new line
- Cursor does NOT jump to the beginning of the previous sentence
- Works correctly in lists (continues list or exits list)
- Works correctly in the middle of text (splits text)
- Works correctly at the end of text (adds new line)
- All existing text formatting functions remain intact
- Bold, italic, and underline buttons work correctly
- Formatting is preserved when pressing Enter

❌ **Previous Bug:**
- Cursor was jumping to the beginning of the sentence instead of staying on the new line
- This was caused by aggressive re-rendering and cursor position restoration
- Fixed by improving Enter key handling and reducing interference during active editing
- All existing formatting functions remain fully functional
